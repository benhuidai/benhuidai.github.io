I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Robotics, Control and Intelligent Systems (EDRS) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, working with [Prof. Josie Hughes](https://people.epfl.ch/josie.hughes?lang=en) in [CREATE Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/create/). Before this, I received my M.Eng. degree from Zhejiang University (ZJU), China, working with [Prof. Lijuan Xie](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0009667) in [IBE team](https://ibe.zju.edu.cn/), and my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering at Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT), China.

I grew up in multi- & inter-disciplines (mechanics, biosystems, materials, arts, etc.) and am working on robotics and human-robot-environment interactions. My research interests lie at soft & rigid robotics, tactile sensors & biosensors, flexible electronics and wearable devices, etc.
