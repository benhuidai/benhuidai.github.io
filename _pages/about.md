I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Robotics, Control and Intelligent Systems (EDRS) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), [CREATE Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/create/), working with [Prof. Josie Hughes](https://people.epfl.ch/josie.hughes?lang=en). Before this, I received my M.Eng. degree from Zhejiang University (ZJU), Hangzhou, China, working with [Prof. Lijuan Xie](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0009667) in [IBE team](https://ibe.zju.edu.cn/), and my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering at Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT), Hangzhou, China.

I grew up in multi- & inter-disciplines (mechanics, biosystems, materials, arts, etc.) and am working on robotics and human-robot-environment interactions.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
